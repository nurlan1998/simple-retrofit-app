# Simple Retrofit App
A simple example usage of Retrofit 2.0

### Description
This is a sample Android Studio project to get started with Retrofit. The app retrieves a json array of database objects(customers), and provides them in form of array of Customer objects. There is nothing there except Retrofit, to make it easier to read and use.

### Usage
Just have a look at the code, or better still, clone it to a local repository in your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/pdrogfer/simple-retrofit-app.git simple-retrofit-app
```
and open it in Android Studio. Feel free to create pull requests to improve the implementation or documentation. Give me a 
star if you find it useful!
Another great milestone in my **Simple** series. Enjoy!
