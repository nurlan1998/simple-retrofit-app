# Simple Retrofit App
A simple example usage of Retrofit 2.0

### Description
This is a sample Android Studio project to get started with Retrofit. The app retrieves a JSONObject from Open Movie Database (search movie title), and parses it to a Movie object. Then fields are extracted from it (url for the poster, and actors names) and displayed to the UI. There is nothing there except Retrofit (and Picasso, to handle the image), to make it easier to read and use.
The Movie object class is generated from json, using [jsonschematopojo](http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/).

### Usage
Just have a look at the code, or better still, clone it to a local repository in your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/pdrogfer/simple-retrofit-app.git simple-retrofit-app
```
and open it in Android Studio. Feel free to create pull requests to improve the implementation or documentation. Give me a 
star if you find it useful!
Another great milestone in my **Simple** series. Enjoy!
