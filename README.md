# Simple Retrofit App

### A simple example of usage of Retrofit 2.0

Another great milestone in my **Simple** series!

This app retrieves a json array of database objects(customers), and provides them in form of array of Customer objects. There is nothing there except Retrofit, to make it easier to read and use. Enjoy!
