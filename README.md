# Simple Retrofit App

### A simple example of usage of Retrofit 2.0

This is a sample Android Studio project, the app retrieves a json array of database objects(customers), and provides them in form of array of Customer objects. There is nothing there except Retrofit, to make it easier to read and use. Enjoy!

Another great milestone in my **Simple** series!
